## General info
Reading a book before bedtime is a common practice for both children and adults. Having spent many nights wondering which book to pick next in my child's "read it again" rotation, I began thinking of a way to log reading history and run simple analytics on the data to tell me which books were being favored over others. Upon completion, I plan to load this onto a small AWS Lightsail instance and use it as a personal utility app.

## Technologies
* MongoDB - version 4.2.8
* Express - version 4.17.1
* Angular - version 10.0.4
* Node.js - version 12.8.3
* Software dependencies listed in package.json and client/package.json

## Setup
Coming soon!

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Create a unique user to track your reading history
* Display your list of books, each with the following data: name, author, web link (for re-purchasing when it mysteriously disappears), read count, last read date
* Select/Add/Delete individual books
* Update the last read time, which will increment the read count automatically

To-do list:
* Client-side coding
* Graphical representation of book list data - bubble, radial, heat graph?
* Other fun and moderately useful things ...

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
